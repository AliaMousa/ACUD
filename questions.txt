Important Note: The default location for the gunicorn binary is /usr/bin/gunicorn.
If the gunicorn binary is installed, in a different location, such as /usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/bin/gunicorn, export this path to the $PATH environment variable for the user thor.
This way you can make use of the gunicorn command without having to provide the absolute path.



Run: sudo npm install pm2@latest -g

You can find the latest version by running the command - sudo npm dist-tag pm2


Q

On app01 create a CSR (certificate signing request) /etc/httpd/csr/app01.csr (key name should be app01.key). Below are the required details which should be used while creating CSR.


a. Country Name = SG

b. State or Province Name = Capital Tower

c. Locality Name = CT

d. Organization Name = KodeKloud

e. Organizational Unit Name = Education

f. Common Name = app01.com

g. Email Address = admin@kodekloud.com

h. Keep challenge password blank.

i. Keep optional company name blank.


A


cd into /etc/httpd/csr directory and run command sudo openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout app01.key -out app01.csr to generate a CSR file.

To verify the entries we used to create a CSR, run the command:

openssl req  -noout -text -in app01.csr


openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -key /etc/httpd/csr/app01.key -out /etc/httpd/certs/app01.crt -subj "/C=SG/ST=Capital Tower/L=CT/O=KodeKloud/OU=Education/CN=app01.com/emailAddress=admin@kodekloud.com"


sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout app01.key -out app01.crt -subj "/C=SG/ST=Capital Tower/L=CT/O=KodeKloud/OU=Education/CN=app01.com/emailAddress=admin@kodekloud.com"




q


On app01 server we have an Apache web server already installed and configured and ssl mode is already enabled. In the /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf file update the SSL certificate and key to use your app01.crt and app01.key files. After making changes remember to restart Apache to apply the config.


For your reference the certificate you created in the previous steps is at /etc/httpd/certs/app01.crt and the key is at /etc/httpd/certs/app01.key. The properties in the file are SSLCertificateFile and SSLCertificateKeyFile. To test if server is using correct certificate or not run this command and check if it returns your certificate:

echo | openssl s_client -showcerts -servername app01.com -connect app01:443 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -inform pem
