Hi Yunise,

Thank you for reaching out. As discussed with Apoorv, the backup files are indeed located at the /root location in our 	QPN PROD environment.
I've attached a screenshot for your reference, showing the backup file in the /root directory. If you encounter any issues locating it or  find that the file provided is incorrect, please feel free to let me know, and I'll be happy to help.

Best regards,
Alia Moussa
