Hi Tanisha,

Thank you for reaching out. I've successfully extracted the folder to the directory "/root/data_backup_extract". If you encounter any issues with the provided extracted backup, please inform me. As a final option, I can also copy the data_backup_ssn_dev.tar.gz instead.

Additionally, could you please check the transmission in QPN and SSN? Also, please test the TNCP connectivity status in DR [SSN-QPN].

Thanks and Regards,
