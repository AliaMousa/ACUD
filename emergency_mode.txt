# Troubleshooting
# First check the /etc/fstab file

Inspect /etc/fstab:

Ensure all entries in /etc/fstab are correct and there are no syntax errors.
Comment out non-essential entries to isolate the problem.

cat /etc/fstab

# Check Filesystem Status:

df -h
lsblk

# In our state the issue was in the /etc/fstab in cdrom

systemctl --failed

# I get an Output tell me the issue in /mount/cdrom 

first I check if the file exists through the following command

ls -ld /mount/cdrom

second I ensured that the redhat iso is connected to the vm and at power on 

--> check the box connect at Power On

Check File System Integrity:

Boot into emergency mode and run fsck on the file systems.

fsch /dev/sdxn

# Identify Errors in Journal Logs:

journalctl -xb | grep -i "failed"
journalctl -xb | grep -i "unable"
journalctl -xb | grep -i "mount"

# Check Systemd Status:
# Use systemctl to check the status of systemd units and identify any failed services.

systemctl status
systemctl --failed

# Check the Status of Systemd Units:

systemctl list-units --state=failed

# Remount Root Filesystem:

mount -o remount,rw /

# Verify Kernel and GRUB Configuration:
# Check and update kernel parameters if necessary.
# Ensure GRUB configuration is correct.

grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

#Review Recent Changes:

# Undo any recent hardware or software changes.
 --> Revert to a previous working state if possible.
 --> Check for Missing or Corrupted Files:

# Reinstall missing or corrupted system packages.

rpm -Va

# Boot into Rescue Mode:

  Use Red Hat installation media to boot into rescue mode for more extensive troubleshooting.

# Seek Help from Logs:

Look at various logs like /var/log/messages or /var/log/syslog for clues.
